/**
 * HMAC is a keyed hash of data - like a hash with a password.
 * To create a HMAC you need to have the key,
 * therefore allowing you to verify both the authenticity and 
 * originator of the data.
 * Using a different key produces a different output.
 * 
 *  -> Think of HMAC as a hash with a password or key
 *  -> Only someone with the key can create an authentic hash
